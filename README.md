## Q5 Component in Vue.js?
In Vue, components are reusable building blocks for constructing user interfaces. They allow us to encapsulate a piece of functionality and UI logic into a self-contained unit. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/components)

## Q6 Vue Directives?
In Vue.js, directives are special tokens in the markup that tell the library to do something to a DOM element. They are prefixed with v- and are Vue-specific attributes added to HTML elements or components.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/directives)

## Q7 v-model?
In Vue.js, the v-model directive is a two-way data binding directive used primarily with form input elements. It creates a binding between the value of an input field and a Vue.js data property.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-model)

## Q8 v-bind Directive?
In Vue.js, the "v-bind" directive is used to dynamically bind HTML attributes to Vue.js data. It allows us to set an attribute's value based on a data property or expression, enabling reactive updates to the attribute whenever the data changes. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-bind)


 ## Q9 v-if Directive?
In Vue, The "v-if" Directive is used to conditionally render an element based on a truthy value. It adds or removes an element from the DOM based on the truthiness of an expression.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-if)

## Q10 v-for Directive?
In Vue, the v-for directive is used to render a list of items based on an array or an object. It iterates over each item in the array or each key-value pair in the object and generates a corresponding DOM element for each item. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-for)

## Q11 v-show Directive?
In Vue, The v-show directive is used to conditionally display an element based on a truthy value. Unlike v-if, which completely "removes" or "adds" the element to the DOM, "v-show" toggles the CSS "display" property of the element to "hide" or "show" it. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-show)

## Q12 v-on Directive?
In Vue.js, the v-on directive is used to attach event listeners to DOM elements. It allows us to listen for and respond to DOM events triggered by user interactions, such as "clicks", "mouse movements" and "keyboard inputs". [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-on)

## Q13 Events in Vue.js?
In Vue, events play a crucial role in facilitating communication between components, allowing them to interact and share information. There are primarily two types of events in Vue.js: [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/events)

## Q14 Methods?
In Vue, methods are functions defined within a Vue component that can be called to perform specific tasks or handle actions triggered by user interactions or other events. Methods are typically defined in the methods option of a Vue component and can be invoked within the template or other methods of the component. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/methods)


 ## Q15 Event Modifier in Vue?
 In Vue, event modifiers are special directives that can be appended to event listeners to modify their behaviour. They provide a convenient way to handle common scenarios such as preventing default browser behaviour, stopping event propagation, or executing event listeners only once.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/event-modifier)
 
## Q16 Computed Properties in Vue.js?
In Vue, computed properties are special properties that are derived from the Vue instance's data and are reactive, meaning they will automatically update when their dependencies change. Computed properties are useful for performing data manipulation, calculations, and filtering in a Vue component, without directly modifying the component's data. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/computed-properties)

 ## Q17 CSS-Binding?
In Vue, we can dynamically bind CSS classes and styles to HTML elements using various approaches. This allows us to apply styles conditionally based on data properties, making your application's UI more flexible and interactive.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/css-binding)

## Q18 Watchers?
In Vue, watchers are a feature that allows us to watch for changes on a specific data property and perform custom logic in response to those changes. Watchers are useful when we need to react to changes in data properties that aren't directly tracked by Vue's reactivity system, such as deep changes in nested objects or arrays, or when we need to perform asynchronous or expensive operations in response to changes. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/watchers)

## Q19 Forms?
In Vue, handling forms is straightforward and flexible, thanks to its two-way data binding and powerful directives. We can easily bind form "inputs" to "data" properties and handle user input using event-handling directives.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/forms)

## Q20 Vue Setup?
Setting up a more advanced Vue.js project involves additional configurations and tools to optimize development, testing, and deployment processes. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/setup)

## Q21 Props?
In Vue, props are a way to pass data from a parent component down to its child components.
They are custom attributes we can register on a component, and the parent component can pass data to the child component via these props. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/props)

## Q22 v-for Components?
To dynamically render multiple instances of a component using v-for in Vue, we need to ensure that each component has a unique key.[read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/v-for-components)

## Q23 Event Emit in Vue.js?
In Vue, "emit" is a method provided by Vue instances and components to communicate upwards in the component tree. It allows child components to trigger events that parent components can listen to and respond to.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/emit)

## Q24 Fallthrough Attributes?
In Vue, fallthrough attributes, also known as "v-bind="rest", allow us to bind all attributes that have not been explicitly declared as props to a single object. This object can then be passed to a "child component", providing a clean way to manage attributes that are not explicitly defined as "props in the child component". [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/fallthrough-attributes)

## Q25 Scoping Styles in Vue.js?
In Vue, we can scope styles to a specific component using various methods. This helps prevent style conflicts between different components and keeps style modules encapsulated.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/scoping-styles)


## Q26 Slots?
Slots in Vue are a powerful feature that allows us to create flexible and reusable components. They enable us to pass content from a parent component to a child component, allowing for dynamic composition of the component's template structure. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/slots)


## Q27 Dynamic Components in Vue?
Dynamic components in Vue.js allow us to switch between different components dynamically at runtime based on certain conditions or user interactions. This is useful when we have multiple components that serve similar purposes but need to be swapped out depending on the application's state. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/dynamic-components)

## Q28 Template Refs?
In Vue, template refs allow us to reference and manipulate DOM elements or components directly within our template. They provide a way to access elements in the template directly without needing to query the DOM manually using Javascript.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/template-refs)

## Q29 Form Inputs?
In Vue, Handling form inputs is straightforward and follows the principles of data binding. We can use the "v-model" directive to create two-way data bindings on form input elements, which means that changes in the input elements will automatically update the associated data in our Vue component, and vice versa. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/form-inputs)

## Q30 Lifecycle Hooks?
In Vue, lifecycle hooks are special methods that allow us to hook into the lifecycle of a Vue instance or component. Hooks provide us an opportunity to perform actions at specific points in the lifecycle, such as before the component is created, mounted, updated, or destroyed.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/lifecycle-hooks)

## Q31 Animations in Vue.js?
In Vue, we can implement animations using CSS animations, and transitions, or by using animation libraries. Vue provides built-in support for adding animations to our components using CSS transitions or CSS animations.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/animations)


## Q32 HTTP Request?
In Vue.js, we can make HTTP requests using various methods, including the native JavaScript fetch API, Axios, or the Vue Resource library. Axios is a widely used HTTP client for making requests in Vue.js applications. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/http-request)

 ## Q33 Routing in Vue.js?
In Vue, we can implement routing using the Vue Router library, which provides a way to navigate between different pages or views in a Vue single-page application (SPA). It provides a powerful and flexible way to manage application navigation, enabling us to define routes, create nested routes and handle dynamic routing.  [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/routing)

## Q34 Provide and Inject in Vue.js?
In Vue.js, Provide and Inject is a feature that allows us to provide data, methods, or any other values to child components without needing to pass them through props explicitly.
This is particularly useful for passing data deeply nested in component trees without having to pass it through intermediate components. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/vue/provide-inject)
 
## Q35 Build in Vue.js?
Building a Vue application typically involves the process of transforming our source code into a format that can be understood and executed by web browsers. This process often involves several steps, such as compiling Vue single-file components, bundling JavaScript files, optimizing assets, and more.
